The First picture width is supposed to be longer. The News picture box is too big.
News text isn't supposed to be all Caps
There's no hover on any of the active text, such as the NavBar, News Titles, and The 1-3 Picture Titles at the bottom
The "We Dive Text" Needs more Line spacing
The "Read More Button" needs more letter Spacing
The "The Bright Future of Web 3.0" and the "We dive into.... " text are too squished together
There needs to be a black hover on the read more button, which you have it need to be darker
The pictures at the bottom are too large, it need to be lined up with the text and smaller -- the same for all 3 pictures.
The 3 bottom pictures and text aren't lined up evenly as the design picture

Everything looks nice and clean
The 3 images at the bottom are still very large compared to the text besides them.
There's a lot of empty space under the "Private funding by VC firms". I would recommend removing some.
The Hamburger button doesn't display a sideBar. Fix the hamburger button.
The Hamburger is the wrong Icon
