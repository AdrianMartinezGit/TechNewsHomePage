The "We Dive Text" Needs more Line spacing<br>
The "Read More Button" needs more letter Spacing<br>
The "The Bright Future of Web 3.0" and the "We dive into.... " text are too squished together<br>
There needs to be a black hover on the read more button, which you have it need to be darker<br>
The pictures at the bottom are too large, it need to be lined up with the text and smaller -- the same for all 3 pictures.<br>
The 3 bottom pictures and text aren't lined up evenly as the design picture<br>

### Tablet Version  (768px)<br>
Everything looks nice and clean<br>
The 3 images at the bottom are still very large compared to the text besides them.<br>
There's a lot of empty space under the "Private funding by VC firms". I would recommend removing some.<br>
